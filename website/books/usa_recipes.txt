If you don't have pumpkin spice on hand, don't worry - it's just a combination of
cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. In this recipe, you can substitute 3/4
teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon each of ginger and
cloves for the pumpkin pie spice.

Remaining pumpkin puree can be frozen in an air-tight container for 1 to 2 months.

Safety Tip: You can be sure your skillet or griddle is hot enough for pancakes
without burning your hand. Just sprinkle a few (3 or 4) drops of water on the
surface. If they dance and sizzle, you are ready to cook. Be sure handles of
skillets and pans are always turned toward the center or back of the stove, to
prevent the pan from catching on hands or clothes and causing burns.
