French Baguette
Ingredients
Starter Dough
1 1⁄2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups lukewarm water (100-110 degrees)
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
Bread
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1⁄2 teaspoons salt
Directions
1. Other equipment: unbleached all-purpose flour for kneading, sesame seeds (optional), cornmeal,
tray of hot water, razor blade, sheetpan, parchment and Dough scraper.
2. Starter Dough: In a small bowl, mix the yeast in the lukewarm water (do the baby's bottle test on
your wrist) and make sure that it bubbles (about 10 minutes).
3. In a bowl large enough for the starter dough to triple, transfer the yeast-water mixture, add the flour
a half a cup at a time mixing it in well with a wooden spoon.
4. When the ingredients have been thoroughly combined, the Starter Dough will be quite soupy.
5. Let the Starter Dough rise, covered, in a no-draught spot on the counter (at room temperature) for 7
to 10 hours.
6. Bread: To make the dough, add 1/2 cup of flour to the Starter Dough.
7. Stir with a wooden spoon.
8. Continue to add all but 1/2 cup of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring all the time.
9. (Note: To make a more rustic bread, use 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c white flour).
10. You don't have to add all the flour.
11. You know it's enough when the dough comes away from the side of the bowl.
12.It will still be quite sticky.
13. Dust your board or counter with some of the last 1/2 c flour and then scrape the dough out of the
bowl.
14. Sprinkle salt over top.
15. Use the extra flour to help you handle the wet dough.
16.Using a dough scraper when the dough sticks to the surface, knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes
until it is smooth and silky (it should feel like your ear lobe when done).
17. Scrape away any dough that is on the board.
18. As you knead, add flour a very little at a time to stop it from sticking.
19. The dough will still be quite loose.
20. Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl.
21.Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a no-draught place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
22.When the dough has doubled, deflate the dough by pushing down on it with your fist and turn it out
onto the board.
23. Divide it in two equal pieces.
24. Sprinkle or Sift a fine coating of flour on the work surface.
25. Place one ball of dough on the surface and gently pat it down to an even thickness of 1 inch.
26. Do not attempt to deflate every air bubble.
27. Using the heels and palms of your hands, flatten the dough into a crude rectangle measuring about
1 inch thick.
28. Fold the long side farthest from you a little over 2/3 of the way toward you.
29. Using the heel of your hand, gently press the folded edge to seal the dough.
30. Pick up the dough and turn it 180 degrees.
31. Fold over the other long edge of the dough about 2/3 of the way, and seal with the palm of your
hand. 32. To make a compact cylinder easy to roll into a baguette shape, use both hands to fold the log
in half lengthwise. 33.This time, as you fold, press your thumbs gently inside the fold to create tension
on the surface of the log. 34.Using your fingertips, press the edges together to seal the dough into a
taut cylinder.
35. This will produce a visible seam running the length of the dough.
36. To roll the dough into a baguette shape, place both hands on the center of the log with your fingers
spread apart.
37.Using light uniform pressure, gently roll the dough back and forth into a long snake.
38. Taking care not to stretch the dough, move your hands from the center of the dough to the ends as
the loaf begins to lengthen to about 14- 16 inches.
39. If the dough resists rolling, let it rest for 5 minutes before continuing.
40. Put the baguette seam side down on a baking pan that has cornmeal (or parchment) sprinkled on
the bottom of the pan.
41.Optional: Wet your hands well and rub the dough. 42. Sprinkle sesame seeds over each baguette.
43. Repeat forming process with the other piece of dough. 
44. Cover sheetpan with plastic wrap thena damp towel and let rise again to almost double (about 45 minutes).
45. Thirty minutes before you are going to bake, turn oven to 500F and Put water into a broiling pan
and place it on the bottom rack of the oven.
46. Slash the top of the baguettes with a very sharp knife or razor blade horizontally across the loaf at
a slight angle- make cuts at 2-3- inch intervals.
47. Spray the baguettes liberally with water.
48. Put bread in oven and immediately turn the oven down to 450F.
49. Bake the bread on the second lowest rack for 30 minutes or until it is hollow sounding on the
bottom.
50. The bread will be done when the internal temperature reaches 200 degrees.
51. Turn off the oven.
52.leave the finished bread in the oven and leave with the door ajar for 5 or 10 minutes.
53. Remove to cool on cooling racks.

French Croissant
Ingredients
3 tablespoons flour
1 1⁄2 cups butter
4 cups flour
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons sugar
2 (7 g) packages dry yeast
1⁄ cup warm water
  4
1 1⁄2 cups milk, warmed to 80 F to 90 F (27 C to 32 C)
1⁄ cup half-and-half, warmed
  2
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
Directions
1. (3/4 pound) of butter and margarine, equally divided and softened at room temperature.
2. Sprinkle 3 Tbsp flour over butter and blend together on the work surface. On a length of foil,
fashion a 6" square of soft butter; fold over the sides of the foil to enclose. Place in the refrigerator to
chill for 2 to 3 hours.
3. While the butter is chilling, prepare the dough. To mix by hand, in a large mixing or mixer bowl,
blend 2 cups of the flour with salt and sugar. Dissolve yeast in warm water and add it and the warmed
milk and half-and-half to the flour mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon or the flat blade of an electric
mixer to thoroughly blend the batterlike dough, about 2 minutes.
4. Stir in additional flour, 1/4 cup at a time, to make a soft but not sticky dough (it will stiffen when
chilled.) Knead by hand or under a dough hook for 5 minutes to form a solid mass.
5. If using a food processor, attach the steel blade. Place 2 cups flour in the work bowl and add the
dry ingredients. Pulse to mix. Pour the 1/4 cup water, milk, and halfand-half through the feed tube.
Pulse once or twice to be certain that all dry ingredients are moistened. Add the balance of the flour,
1/2 cup at a time, turning the machine on briefly after each addition. When the mixture forms a mass
and begins to clean the sides of the bowl, knead for 30 seconds. Don't overknead! 6. This begins the
process of cooling the dough and at the same time allowing it to rise. Cover the bowl with plastic
wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
7. Determine that both butter and dough are about the same temperature — 65°F (23°C) is ideal. The
block of butter should bend but not break (too cold) nor be oily (too warm) when bent slightly. This
may mean taking the butter out of the refrigerator an hour or so early to reach workable temperature.
Likewise for the dough. Place the dough on a floured work surface and with the hands press it into a
10" square. Unwrap the block of butter and lay the block diagonally on the dough. Bring each point of
dough into the center, overlapping the edges at least 1". Press the dough into a neat package. With a
heavy rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle, approximately 8" x 18". This dimension is not
critical. 8. Caution: If the butter seems to be breaking into small pieces under the dough rather than
remaining solid, allow the dough/butter to warm a few minutes. But if the butter softens, becomes
sticky, and oozes while making the turns, put the dough back into the refrigerator for several minutes.
9. Fold the length of dough into thirds, as for a letter. Turn so that the open ends are at twelve and six
o'clock. Roll again into a rectangle. This time, fold both ends into the middle and then close, as one
would a book. The dough will now be in 4 layers. Wrap the package of dough in a cloth (an old tea
towel is good) that has been soaked in cold water and wrung dry. Place the wrapped dough in the
refrigerator to relax and chill for 1 or 2 hours. 10. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place
on the floured work surface. Unwrap, roll out, and fold in thirds, as for a letter. This is the final turn
before it is rolled out and cut into croissants. Dampen cloth again and wrap loosely around the dough.
Place the package in a plastic bag so moisture will be retained (not pulled out of the cloth). Leave in
the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours or overnight.
11. Mix together the egg and 1 Tbsp of water. Have ready the egg wash, a knife or pastry cutter, and a
wooden yardstick if you wish the pieces to be cut precisely otherwise, plan to cut them freehand. You
may have or can borrow a French croissant cutter that cuts the dough into triangles.
12. Sprinkle work surface with flour. Roll the dough until it is a generous 10"-x-38" rectangle, and,
most importantly, about 1/4" thick. This is a crucial dimension, since it determines the size and texture
of the croissants. Trim irregularities to make the strip uniform in width. Cut the strip lengthwise to
make two 5" pieces. Mark the strip into triangles, 5" wide on the bottom. Using a yardstick as a guide,
cut through the dough with a pastry or pizza cutter or knife. Separate the triangles, place them on a
baking sheet, and chill for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll the dough into the traditional croissant shape, by
rolling the triangle from the bottom to the point.
